# Jellyfin Desktop

Jellyfin desktop client built with Qt WebEngine and [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). Supports audio passthrough, hardware decoding, and playback of more formats without transcoding.

This fork targets **Apple Silicon macOS only**. The Windows, Linux and Intel Mac
builds, and the platform code behind them, have been removed; see
[docs/macos-only.md](docs/macos-only.md) for what went and why.

## Building
See [dev/macos/](dev/macos/) for build instructions.

## File Locations
Data is stored per-profile in a `profiles/<profile-id>/` subdirectory. The main configuration file is `jellyfin-desktop.conf`. You can also add `mpv.conf` to configure MPV directly.

- Config: `~/Library/Application Support/Jellyfin Desktop/profiles/<profile-id>/`
- Cache: `~/Library/Caches/Jellyfin Desktop/profiles/<profile-id>/`
